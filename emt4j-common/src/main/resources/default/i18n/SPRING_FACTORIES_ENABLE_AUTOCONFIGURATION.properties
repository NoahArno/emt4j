title=spring.factories uses EnableAutoConfiguration (Spring Boot 3 migration)
description=Found META-INF/spring.factories containing org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration. In Spring Boot 3, auto-configuration classes must be declared in META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports.
solution=Move the auto-configuration class list from META-INF/spring.factories to META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports, and remove the old EnableAutoConfiguration entry.
