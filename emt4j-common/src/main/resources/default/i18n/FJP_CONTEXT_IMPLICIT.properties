title=Uses implicit common thread pool (high risk)
description=The code uses APIs that implicitly execute tasks on the JDK common ForkJoinPool (e.g., CompletableFuture.runAsync/supplyAsync without an Executor, or ForkJoinPool.commonPool). This can lead to thread context issues (TCCL/MDC/SecurityContext), unexpected performance interference across components, and deadlocks when blocking operations are performed on compute pools after upgrading to JDK 11/17.
solution=Always pass an explicit Executor to CompletableFuture *Async methods and avoid calling ForkJoinPool.commonPool directly. Use a dedicated thread pool (or ForkJoinPool) with a proper ThreadFactory (set thread name and context ClassLoader) and keep the whole async chain consistently on the same Executor.
