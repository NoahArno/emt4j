title=Uses common ForkJoinPool (parallel APIs may run with unexpected context)
description=The code uses parallel APIs that may execute on the JDK common ForkJoinPool. When upgrading from JDK 8 to newer JDKs (11/17), the execution thread context (e.g., context ClassLoader) is more likely to differ from the application context in containers/frameworks, which can cause ClassNotFound/SPI loading issues or unexpected behavior.
solution=Prefer explicit execution context: (1) avoid parallel APIs when not necessary; (2) use a dedicated Executor/ForkJoinPool with a proper ThreadFactory (set thread name and context ClassLoader); (3) ensure all asynchronous stages consistently use the same Executor and avoid blocking operations on compute pools.
